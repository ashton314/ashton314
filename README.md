### About Me

I'm picky about my programming languages—I like exploring new languages and technologies and learning what kind of trade-offs they offer. More about me on [my blog](https://ashton.wiersdorf.org/about/).

**What's the deal with the username?** I picked this username when I was in high school. My biggest claim to fame back then was knowing 100 digits of pi, so I appended the first three digits to my username. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

**What are you interested in?** This changes from time to time. Right now I'm enjoying writing compilers in Racket. I frequently tweak my Emacs configuration, and I dabble in private web application development in Elixir.
