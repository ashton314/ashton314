## About Me

I'm picky about my programming languages—I like exploring new languages and technologies and learning what kind of trade-offs they offer. More about me on [my blog](https://lambdaland.org/about/).

I'm a PhD student at the University of Utah. (Starting Fall 2022) I'll be doing some fun research there!

### What's the deal with the username?
I picked this username when I was in high school. My biggest claim to fame back then was knowing 100 digits of pi, so I appended the first three digits to my username. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

### What are you interested in?
This changes from time to time. Right now I'm enjoying writing compilers in Racket. I frequently tweak my Emacs configuration, and I dabble in private web application development in Elixir.

### Where do you work?
I'm currenty working at [Spiff Inc.](https://spiff.com). They're letting me hack on an interpreter for their custom DSL, so I'm delighted I get to put a little of my PL interests into practice.
