## About Me

I'm picky about my programming languages—I like exploring new languages and technologies and learning what kind of trade-offs they offer. More about me on [my homepage](https://lambdaland.org/).

I'm a PhD student at the [University of Utah](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) advised by [Ben Greenman](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~blg/).

### What are you interested in?
Right now I'm working on pushing the boundaries of what macro systems can do. I also enjoy writing compilers in Racket and tinkering with type systems. I frequently tweak my Emacs configuration, and occasionally do some light web development with Elixir.

### Where do you work?
I work as a research assistant at the [University of Utah](https://www.cs.utah.edu/). You can see my employment history on my résumé on [my homepage](https://lambdaland.org).

### What's the deal with the username?
I picked this username when I was in high school. My biggest claim to fame back then was knowing 100 digits of pi, so I appended the first three digits to my username. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
